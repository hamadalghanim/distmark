We use multiple technologies to establish a distributed system, such as docker compose to emulate multiple machines and easily network them. The Go language is used as a CLI application as an interface, this was chosen for its simplicity and performance. The frontend uses Flask and connects to gRPC endpoints built on Python. The databases are PostgreSQL instances deployed through Docker. The Python gRPC server connects to the databases using SQLAlchemy, creating database tables and handling seeding for testing. Currently, within the scope of the assignment, everything works. However, it is worth mentioning that when a customer makes a purchase, there is a small chance the payment goes through but the quantity has been allocated to another client whose payment went through faster, due to random scheduling and networking. We deployed the solution to GCP using Ansible, coupled with our Docker configuration, making it as simple as running `ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml deploy.yml`.
