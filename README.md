The use multiple technologies to establish a distributed system, such as docker compose to emulate multiple machines and easily network them. The Go language as a cli application as an interface, this was chosen for its simplicity and performance. The frontend uses a python server that spins up threads per socket connection, to allow multiple clients to connect at the same time. The databases are postgres sql deployed through docker. The python frontend connects to the databases using SqlAlchemy creating database tables and handling seeding for testing.
